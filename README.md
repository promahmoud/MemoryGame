# Memory Game

In my **track Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree**  on udacity site, I was asked to create this game where upon clicked,two card match and stay open . once all  cards  are matched a message appears  congratulates the tester for winning the game. The popup gives a score from 1 to 3, how much time it took, and how many moves it took to finish the game

## How to Play:

* The goal is to match all the cards together and win the game.

2. Keep matching up pairs until all cards are matched and faced up. 

3. Congratulations, you win! An alert window appears tell you your score, time, and moves it took to complete the game. If there is an issue with a single card randomly paired, just hit the restart button on the top right corner of the game.
